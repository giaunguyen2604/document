**Summarize:**
Next.js 15 introduces several key updates focused on improving performance, developer experience, and integration with modern technologies:

- **Turbopack**: The new default bundler, replacing Webpack, promises up to 700x faster build speeds, making development significantly more efficient.

- **React 19 Integration**: This release supports React 19, introducing advanced features like server and client actions and the React Compiler. The React Compiler reduces the need for manual memoization, optimizing rendering without useMemo or useCallback.

- **Improved Caching**: Next.js 15 no longer caches fetch requests, route handlers, and client-side navigation by default, giving developers more control over caching behavior to avoid stale data.

- **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**: This feature combines static and dynamic rendering, boosting performance by allowing parts of a page to load statically while others load dynamically in the same request.

- **next/after API**: A new API that allows tasks like logging or analytics to be processed after the server response is sent, improving response times for essential tasks.

Additionally, the revamped error handling provides clearer hydration error messages, making debugging easierâ€‹.

## [REACT 19](https://vercel.com/blog/whats-new-in-react-19)
Here's a summary of the new changes in React v19:

- **React Compiler**: Converts React code into regular JavaScript, potentially doubling performance.

- **Server Components**: Allows components to run on the server, improving performance and enabling better SEO.

- **Actions**: Simplifies handling data and interactions within web pages.

- **Document Metadata**: Enhances the ability to manage metadata for better SEO and accessibility.

- **Asset Loading**: Enables assets to load in the background, improving load times and user experience.

- **Enhanced Hooks**: New hooks like useFormStatus, useFormState, and useOptimistic to streamline state management and form handling.

- **Web Components**: Integrates with web components, unlocking more possibilities for developers.

- **Concurrent Rendering**: Improves time-to-interactive and overall rendering performance.

- **Automatic SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Enhances SEO by preparing pages on the server first.

- **Suspense**: Provides smoother user experiences by better handling asynchronous operations.
